# Homework 1.2
Complete list of completed tasks:
* Selection: tab pick (I used the W key because tab selected the URL in my browser)
* Position manipulation: arrow keys
* Orientation manipulation:
* Editing: new (N, mouse click), delete (backspace)
* View: scroll with I J K L, zoom with X and Z
* Combo: camera & creation. N will create at the center of the camera view, clicking will create at the point of clicking regardless of camera location

Press P to change the mouse click from (not really functional) orientation manipulation to new object creation
