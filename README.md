* Homework 1.1
Use keys E, S, J, X, and the arrow keys to toggle images and manipulate some of them. 
	** Part 1: Donut: Draw a disc with a hole in it. Place vertices along two concentric circles, computing vertex coordinates in your code. Triangles should span between the circles.
	** Part 2: Egg: Draw a quadrifolium. Obtain the perimeter vertices by evaluating a rose-curve formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)) for several values of t in [0, 2 pi].
	** Part 3: Checkers: Some objects should have a checkered pattern. The square size and colors should be parametrizable (uniforms in the shader). Draw at least two objects using the same shaders but with different square colors and sizes.
	** Part 4: Heartbeat: At least one object should have smoothly changing, pulsating colors.
	** Part 5:
	** Part 6: Arrow move: Change position of the avatar when the arrow keys are held down. Warp it around if it leaves the canvas.
